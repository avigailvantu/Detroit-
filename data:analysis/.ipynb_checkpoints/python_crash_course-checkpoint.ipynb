    "Most computer programs are static in nature. They generally consist of a set of predefined steps which are stored in a text file on a computer. As needed, the contents of the file are fed to the **interpreter** -- the program which turns code into computer instructions (more on this later) -- and are executed as a unit. Here's an example of what a typical Python file looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# my_program.py\n",
    "\n",
    "x = \"Hello, World!\"\n",

    "The above program consists of three steps. The first line `# my_program.py` is what's called a <strong>*comment*</strong>. In Python, any line prefaced with a `#` is a comment and is ignored. In other words, the first line is the name of the file. It is purely stylistic and has no effect on the behavior of the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step, `x = \"Hello, World!\"`, is a bit more interesting. In this case, the program is instructing the computer to create a reference, `x`, to some chunk of memory and to store inside that chunk of memory the **string** \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last step, `print(x)`, instructs the computer to <strong>*invoke*</strong> (or call) a **function** called `print` with an **argument** (or input) of `x`. `print` is another program built-in to python that accepts an input and prints it to the screen.\n",

Datasets come in all different shapes and sizes, often require various unpredictable preprocessing steps (AKA <strong>*wrangling*</strong>) before they can be worked with.\n",

Different types of objects have different characteristics. This is also something we need not fully understand for now. Just acknowledging that there are differences is perfectly sufficient for our purposes. Below are some examples of object types. In the below examples we make use of a <strong>*function*</strong> (more on this shortly) called `type`, which simply takes an object and returns the object's type. Have a look:"

    "### Functions\n",
    "In our last few examples we made use of a function called `type`, but what is a function? One of the fundamental rules of programming is D.R.Y or Don't Repeat Yourself. Functions allow us take a complex set of commands which we don't want write over and over again, assign them name (another form of a variable FYI), and reuse as needed. This makes our programs more readable and can also abstract away some of the unimportant details. Functions can optionally accept arguments. Many functions, such as `type`, are built-in Python's standard libraries, but we can define our own as well as make use of third-party defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below example I've defined a function called `titleize`, which given a title will capitalize the first letter of each word. As you can see the logic I use to accomplish this is complex enough that I wouldn't want to have to re-write it over and over again. Instead I can reuse the function I've defined over and over again as needed. Give it a try:"
