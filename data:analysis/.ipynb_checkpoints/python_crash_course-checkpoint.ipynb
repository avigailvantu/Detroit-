    "Most computer programs are static in nature. They generally consist of a set of predefined steps which are stored in a text file on a computer. As needed, the contents of the file are fed to the **interpreter** -- the program which turns code into computer instructions (more on this later) -- and are executed as a unit. Here's an example of what a typical Python file looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# my_program.py\n",
    "\n",
    "x = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above program consists of three steps. The first line `# my_program.py` is what's called a *comment*. In Python, any line prefaced with a `#` is a comment and is ignored. In other words, the first line is the name of the file. It is purely stylistic and has no effect on the behavior of the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step, `x = \"Hello, World!\"`, is a bit more interesting. In this case, the program is instructing the computer to create a reference, `x`, to some chunk of memory and to store inside that chunk of memory the **string** \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last step, `print(x)`, instructs the computer to invoke a **function** called `print` with an **argument** (or input) of `x`. `print` is another program built-in to python that accepts an input and prints it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below is meant to demonstrate how this program would run. Give it a try!"
